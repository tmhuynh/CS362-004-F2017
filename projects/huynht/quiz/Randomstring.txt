The task is to fill inputChar and inputString with code so that random generations of characters spell out “error.”


The inputChar function has to be able to return each char that is checked in the statements. So the implementation returns a randomly generated ASCII char within the range of 32, and 126. This range includes the chars that are in the if statements within testme.c. 


Due to the potential long run time of the function inputString, I realized that I did not need to check everything, only string inputs between a and z specifically because “error” is all lowercase. In ASCII this is 97 through 122, so this is what the function checked.


I was able to run the functions to completion 3 times, with large variance in completion times, but all were well under 5 minutes.
